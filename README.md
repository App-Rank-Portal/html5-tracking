# html5-trackinghtml5 video tracking code with criteria to identify the video title being watched, watch duration, skipping duration, ad revenue received.

In this example, we define variables for video title, watch duration, skipping duration, and ad revenue. We then add event listeners for the play, ended, and timeupdate events of the video element.

When the video starts playing (play event), we record the start time of the watch. When the video ends (ended event), we calculate the watch duration and log all the tracked variables.

During video playback, if the user skips more than 5 seconds (timeupdate event), we assume that an ad was displayed and add $1 to the ad revenue. We also record the start time of the skipped section.

Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements.
